# Portforlio-CS-255
The DriverPass project was the concept of having a system that would provide information about driving tests and lessons with the goal of helping the customer be able to pass their test at the DMV. Additionally, the system will also be able to allow the customer the ability to schedule in-person driving lessons from a selection of drivers and packages. The training can be bought in packages that are pre-determined by the owner. The customer has the ability to choose the driver and vehicle they wish to perform with during these packages. The system should be a web-based system with the preference of running off of the cloud.
When it comes to designing the system, I feel that I did really well on the activity diagrams, which goes in depth into certain actions the system should perform. I did not do too well with the sequence diagram and didn't feel comfrotable with my class diagram. IF there was a document I had to improve, it would definitely be docoument from Project Two. Reason being is that I didn't upload my class diagram, which I have the hardest time creating. 
When it comes to designing software, I believe that plan-coordinating is an extremely aspect of it. Developing Gantt Charts can help with the timeline of the project, and UML diagrams (State, activity, sequence, and class) are great for visualizing the elements and interactions that need to occur within the system.
